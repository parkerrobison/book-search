# Google Book Search

  ## Description 
  
  Google Book Search is an application that uses a google api to search for books. If a user is logged into an account not only can they search for book titles on the app but they can save them to their account. This can allow a user to accumulate a list of books that they are interested in reading. Once the user has decided that they want to remove a title from their collection they can do so with the click of a button. This was a refactoring project, as the application already existed as a RESTful API. The goal was to convert it into a GraphQl API built with Apollo Server.
